# UE-eNodeB Attachment Study in LTE Networks

## Overview
This project focuses on studying the attachment of User Equipment (UE) to evolved NodeBs (eNodeB) in LTE networks. Using NS3, a network simulator, we simulate LTE network scenarios enhanced with real-world user distribution from the RioBus dataset.

## Approaches
We have implemented two approaches to optimize UE-eNodeB attachments:
1. **Heuristic Approach**: This method provides a baseline performance for UE-eNodeB attachments.
2. **Genetic Algorithm**: An advanced approach that iteratively improves the attachment strategy for better network performance.
